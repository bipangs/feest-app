# Food Swap Request System Implementation

I've successfully implemented the complete food swap request system as requested. Here's what's been created:

## ‚úÖ Features Implemented

### 1. Request System
- **FoodSwapRequestButton**: Updated to create transactions instead of simple requests
- **Transaction Creation**: When someone presses "Request Swap", a transaction is created
- **Notifications**: Owner gets notified in the transactions tab

### 2. Transaction Management
- **Accept/Reject**: Owner can accept or reject requests from transactions tab
- **Food Status Updates**: 
  - Available ‚Üí Requested (when accepted)
  - Requested ‚Üí Available (when rejected)
  - Requested ‚Üí Completed (when finished)

### 3. Chat Room Integration
- **Auto-Creation**: Chat room automatically created when request is accepted
- **Owner as Admin**: Food owner becomes chat room admin
- **Requester as Participant**: Requester becomes chat participant
- **Coordination**: Both parties can chat to coordinate the swap

### 4. Transaction Completion
- **Photo Proof**: Owner must provide completion photo
- **Auto-Expiry**: Chat room automatically closes 3 hours after completion
- **Cleanup**: System automatically deletes expired chats

### 5. User Interface
- **TransactionNotifications**: New component showing pending requests and active swaps
- **Status Indicators**: Clear visual indicators for different transaction states
- **Action Buttons**: Easy accept/reject buttons for owners

## üìÅ Files Created/Modified

### New Files:
1. `components/transactions/TransactionNotifications.tsx` - Main notifications interface
2. `TRANSACTION_SETUP_GUIDE.md` - Database setup guide

### Modified Files:
1. `services/foodService.ts` - Updated food swap request creation
2. `services/transactionService.ts` - Added new methods for transaction lifecycle
3. `components/food/FoodSwapRequestButton.tsx` - Updated to use new transaction system
4. `app/(tabs)/transactions.tsx` - Updated to use notification system
5. `components/auth/AuthWrapper.tsx` - Added service initialization
6. `components/transactions/index.ts` - Added new component export

## üîÑ Workflow Process

### Step 1: Food Request
1. User sees available food item
2. Presses "Request Swap" button
3. System creates transaction with status "pending"
4. Food owner gets notification in transactions tab

### Step 2: Owner Response
1. Owner opens transactions tab
2. Sees pending request notification
3. Can view request message and requester details
4. Chooses to Accept or Reject

### Step 3A: If Accepted
1. Transaction status ‚Üí "accepted"
2. Food item status ‚Üí "requested"
3. Chat room automatically created
4. Both parties can coordinate swap details
5. Owner completes transaction with photo proof
6. Chat expires in 3 hours and gets deleted

### Step 3B: If Rejected
1. Transaction status ‚Üí "cancelled"
2. Food item status ‚Üí "available" (back to listing)
3. Chat room deleted (if existed)

## üõ† Technical Features

### Transaction States:
- **pending**: Waiting for owner response
- **accepted**: Owner accepted, chat active
- **completed**: Swap finished with proof
- **cancelled**: Request rejected

### Automatic Cleanup:
- Periodic cleanup runs every hour
- Expired chats automatically deleted
- System maintains clean database

### Real-time Updates:
- Pull-to-refresh functionality
- Status indicators update in real-time
- Notifications show immediately

### Error Handling:
- Proper validation for all actions
- User-friendly error messages
- Graceful failure handling

## üéØ Next Steps

To complete the setup:

1. **Database Collections**: Create the `transactions` collection in Appwrite with the attributes listed in `TRANSACTION_SETUP_GUIDE.md`

2. **Permissions**: Set up proper read/write permissions for the transactions collection

3. **Testing**: Test the complete flow:
   - Create food item
   - Request swap
   - Accept/reject
   - Chat coordination
   - Complete transaction
   - Verify auto-cleanup

The system is now ready for use and provides a complete end-to-end food swap experience with proper notifications, chat integration, and automatic cleanup!
